                    <P> Hello! My name is <b>William Ross</b>. Currently, I am living in Spain, Valencia.
                        I am a hardworking and goal-oriented person with a great motivation
                        to achieve high results and become a highly qualified professional. I am
                        fluent in several foreign languages and constantly growing in this direction. You can always rely
                        on me. I am a responsible and communicative person with a positive attitude to the
                        world.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        My main goal at work is to do more than anyone expects from me and grow
                        as a professional together with the company.
